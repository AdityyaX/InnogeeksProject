**Repository Link**: [CodersPree](https://github.com/InnogeeksOrganization/Coderspree3.0)

1. **OS Strategy Matrix**: The job runs on `ubuntu-latest` using a matrix setup to specify the operating system.
  
2. **Steps**:
   - **Checkout Repository**: Uses `actions/checkout@v2` to check out the repository code.
   - **Set Up Python**: Configures the Python environment using `setup-python@v2`, specifically setting Python version 3.8.
   - **Install Dependencies**: Installs the necessary Python packages (`requests` and `mdutils`) to support the script.
   - **Run Script**: Executes `check_submissions.py` to perform the core task of submission verification.
   - **Auto-Commit**: Uses `stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4` to automatically commit any updates to the repository with a custom commit message ("Update Readme").

This workflow ensures that each submission check is efficiently handled, updates are tracked, and any changes made by the script are automatically committed back to the repository.
